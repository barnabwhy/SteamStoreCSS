# Steam Store CSS

Improvements to the Steam store's default CSS.

Aims to make the styling of the store more consistent and modern without straying far from the style of existing Steam products.

This is a WIP however the majority of style changes on the store home page are complete.

## Installation
By any means suitable, inject the CSS file into store.steampowered.com
For Firefox I suggest using the [CSS Override addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/css-override/)
